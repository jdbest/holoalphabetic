#' holoalphabetic: Interactive word games to find pangrams
#'
#' Like the New York Times' "Spelling Bee", the package gives you a set of 7 or
#' more letters and invites you to identify all possible words using those
#' letters. Find the pangram which uses all 7, or simply identify as many words
#' as possible with those letters. The word lists come from the Spell Checking
#' Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL) by Kevin Atkinson, which can be found at
#' \url{http://wordlist.aspell.net/scowl-readme}.
#'
#' @section holoalphabetic functions:
#' The primary functions in holoalphabetic are \code{\link{play_game}}, which
#' lets you actually play the game, and \code{\link{create_game}}, which just
#' sets a game up for you.
