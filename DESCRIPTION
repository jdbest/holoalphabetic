Description: Inspired by the New York Times' "Spelling Bee", the package gives 
    you a set of 7 or more letters and invites you to identify all possible 
    words using those letters. Find the pangram which uses all 7, or simply 
    identify as many words as possible with those letters. The word lists 
    come from the Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL) by Kevin Atkinson,
    which can be found at http://wordlist.aspell.net/scowl-readme.
